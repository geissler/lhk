As such they were strongly fortified and manned for the defence of what had been won, ready to become bases for future offensives.

  note = {Kolonietypen In the great days of the Roman Republic, in the fourth, third and second centuries, the colonies sent out by the Romans were of two kinds. The one kind, the so-called Latin colonies (coloniae Latinae), were peopled by settlers who did not possess the Roman citizenship; the other kind, the so-called Citizen colonies (coloniae civium Romanorum), were peopled by settlers who did. Since both kinds of colonies were authorized and established by the Roman state, it may well be asked what determined the choice of one type rather than the other on any given occasion.  15},
  note = {Bürgerkolonien Down to the Second Punic War the Romans used Citizen colonies only for small garrisons on the littoral, directly linked to Rome and, apart form their sea front, entirely surrounded by Roman territory. Both the Latin and the Citizen colonies played a significant role in the Roman conquest and organization of Italy, so much so in fact that Velleius Paterculus, writing in AD 30, thought it worth while to list thier names and the dates when they were founded, since they had contributed so markedly to 'the spread of the Roman name'. The parlous state of Velleius` text makes his information very unreliable, but the fact that he was prepared to insert an exursus on coloniae into his short compendium of Roman history is an indication that he regarded them as one of the most important of Roman political institutions.  17},
  note = {Kolonien - Aussehen According to Aulus Gellius (Aul. Gell CVI, 13, 9) the coloniae 'have the appearance of miniatures, and are reproductions of Rome herself', and although Gellius was referring to colonies of his own day (AD 169), his description is valid to a great extent also for those of the Republic. Nevertheless, despite thier uniform tendency to imitate Rome and her institutions, coloniae might still differ from one another in a number of ways.  18},
  note = {Auffinden Examples of centuriation have been clearly revealed by air photography in various parts of the Roman Empire, above all in the Po valley and un Tunisis, and they graphcally illustrate Roman land settlement. Since centuriation was used also for viritane distribution, these are not always the relics of colonies. But traces of centuriation can still be discerned at the sites of many of the early colonies in Italy: Luceria, Cosa, Paestum, Ariminum, Beneventum, Drunisium, Spoletium, Cremona, Placentia, Vibo, Bononia (all Latin), Antium, Tarracina, Puteoli, Salernum, Pisaurum, Parma, Mutina, Auximum (all Citizen). Unfortunately the cenuriation as a rule cannot be dated but some specimens of it probably go back to the original colonization.  23 f.Examples of cen},
  note = {Landzuordnugnsgröße In any case, after the Second Punic War, the allotments got bigger. Whereas 2 iugera consituted the standard allotment in the early Citizen colonies, 200 might be given in imperial times. After the Second Punic War, also, it became normal for the size fo allotments in Latin colonies to depend on the recipient`s status, centurions and troopers obtaining far more land than the other colonists.  25},
  note = {Aussehen und Unterschiedliche Typen Excavations at Ostia, Minturnae and Pyrgi suggest that the small Ciitzen colonies of the fourth and third  centuries looked like Roman army camps, which in effect is what they were: they were rectangular, had a gate in each wall, a peripheral road, and a checkerboard plan.  26 f},
  note = {Aussehen Nevertheless, with all the shifts fo fashion and theory, the general plan and layout of the coloniae remained recognizably similar for centuries, a state of affairs to which the traditional founding formalities, essentially unchanging, undoubtedly contributed. At some of the sites, especially those of later colonies such as Augusta Praetoria, Augusta Taurinorum, Sarmizegethusa and Thamugadi, the symmetry of the grid is quite remarkable. In earlier colonies, such as Alba Fucens, Cosa and Ariminum, rectangular city-blocks rather than square are the rule and the town walls follow the contours of the land: but even in them symmetry is anything but absent.  27},
  note = {Aufbau - Gebäude - Ausstattung Just inside it there was a pomerial raod, and near the heart of the town, sometimes at its very centre, there was a forum. The shape of this in the early Republic may have been irregular to conform with the topographical exigencies of the site, but from the third century onwards it was normally rectangular. Hard by the forum, if not actually adjoining it, and axially aligned with it, would be appropriate public buildings of Roman type: a temple, a curia (where the local senate [ordo] met), and a basilica, presenting its long side to the forum and serving as law court and commercial centre. Sometimes, especially after 100, a portico might surround part, or even all, of the forum, and well before 100 there is at least one colony where entrance to the forum was gained by way of an arch. Other public structures of the colonia, particularly in the days of the Empire, might include triumphal arches, baths, theatres and, usually outside the town wall, amphitheatres. In such details as terracotta ornaments, cornice mouldings and the like the buildings might show the effects of local influences. But in general the colonies, Latin and later Citizen alike, must have displayed a consistently Roman aspect.  27 f.},
  note = {Cosa Such a favourable combination of circumstances, found at no other colonial site, has made of Cosa 'the very paradigm of a Latin colony'. There one can learn what the defences, the street plan, public buildings and housing arragements of a Latin colony were like.  29},
  note = {Frühe Kolonien Like many another early Latin colony - Signia, Norba, Setia, Narnia, Hadria, Firmum - it was perched on a hill.  29},
  note = {Kolonie Bauplan The frequent parallels that one can draw between Cosa and other colonies show that the Romans mus have had a master plan or  'blue print' for a deductio. By the time that they applied it at Cosa they had already had much experience in using it, having established no fewer than thirteen Latin and six Citizen colonies since 338. Hence it is not surprising that they could make the town so typical and so excellent an example of colonization. It displays a neater and tidier arrangement of town wall and rectangular grid of streets than does Alba Fucens thirty years earlier. It abundantly confirms Cicero`s description of a colonia as ''a watch-tower and bulwark''. And it even confirms that a colonia was founded with the formalities and ceremonies traditionally believed to have been observed at the foundation of Rome itself.  38 f.},
  note = {Latinische Kolonien - Platzwahl All these sites wer skilfully chosen, and defence considerations were uppermost in their selection. All of them were militarily useful and most of them naturally strong. Almost every one was perched on a hilltop; some were flanked by ravines; streams protected others and forests camouflaged yet others. Ostensibly peopled by peasant-farmers, they were in fact powerful bastions, and their strategic contribution was notable. They formed a network of fortresses, controlling  river crossings, mountain passes, roads and tracks, and they could frustrate enemy combinations. Through them the Romano-Latin alliance was successful in completing and consolidating its grip upon Latium.  43},
  note = {Kolonisierung Latiums Sutrium, Nepet and Setia, c. 383/382, were the last foundations for almost half a century, until after the Latin War (340-338) in fact, by which time the political climate had become very different.  44},
  note = {Latinische Kolonien nach dem Latiner Krieg These seven even continued to be known as coloniae Latinae, even though the Latin League had now disappeared and their allegiance now belonged exclusively to Rome. So far as the ancient evidence goes, Rome did not found them anew or send additional colonists to them at this time, she simply defined their constitutional status as that of Latin colonies. Technically they wer non-Roman, but at the same time they were not regarded as completely foreign.  Ardea, Circei, Nepet, Norba, Setia, Signia and Sutrium wer the select seven.  51},
  note = {Latinische Kolonien Bewertung Thus, even though it may be conceded that the large-scale use of the municipium in 338 ''contributed far more than the Roman colony to the making of Rome`s subsequent constitutional history'', the retention of the Latin colony after the dissolution of the Latin League is also to be reckoned a masterpiece of statecraft: the Latin colonies, it has been well said, wer the real instrument in the romanization of Italy.  54},

BC colonization is generally accepted as historical fact. The general process of settelment expansion taking place in Central Italy in the 7th and 6th centuries BC as documented by the various projects I have mentioned does furnish a context that may explain the 6th c. BC acts of colonization, as reported in Livy, as reminiscences of gradual territorial expansion during the Archais period. In other words it may simply have been a form of population pressure from the proto-urban core areas towards the periphery.  124},
  note = {Funktion Livy`s claim that these areas in the margins of the citystates became subject to settler colonization on the part of the Romans in the 5th and 4th centuries BC, seems to be archaeologically corroborated by the existence of such fortified sites as Signium and Norba. It concerns a mode of colonization involving strongholds intended to control the surrounding countryside and the vital communication routes.  124},

  note = {Latinische Kolonien Over the last five decades our knowledge of teh large Roman (so-called Latin) colonies in Italy has been advanced greatly the excavations of Alba Fucens, Cosa, Paestum and, most recently, Fregellae.  37},
  note = {Koloniesierungs Prinzip For whenever questions of archaeological and historical interpretation arise from these sites, the answer invariably has been sought in the structures and practices of the mother-city, which is assumed to have provided a blueprint for all the new communities founded throughout Italy. The paradox is that, following this model-replica approach, they have come up with solutions that differ substantially from each other.  37},
  note = {Kolonie Ausstehen Logically the argument consists of three parts: (1) a general explanatory model that suggests that colonies wer direct copies of the mother-city; (2) the identification of structures in Rome that might have served as models for specific colonial structures; and (3) the practical application of theses models to the colonial evidence.  37 f},
  note = {Kopien von Rom These Fundamental to this approach is the perception of Latin colonies as minature versions of Rome, wich allows colonial structures to be explained by reference to the political practices and institutions of Republican Rome. We therefore shall have to consider to what extent this represents a reasonable hypothesis.  38},
  note = {Cosa - Kapitol Thus, in Cosa the highest part of the promontory, on which the town was founded, has been identified as an emulation of the Roman Capitol, featuring not only a Tempel of Jupiter but also one for Rome`s tutelary triad. Scholars have pointed out also the strikingly uniform desing of the meeting-places for the assembly and the local senate. In all four colonies we find variations of the same tpye of integrated Curia-Comitium complex, whose model has been identified in the northeastern corner of the Fourm Romanum.  38},
  note = {Curia - Comitium - Grundlagen The Curia-Comitium complexes in the Latin colonies show difference in size, location and architectural details, but overall they remain broadly similar in their layout. In this case the decision to folow Roman building types clearly was not based on purely practical considerations. Like the examples of religious emulation, it is possible to interpret this as a visual manifestation of the close ties to Rome and a declaration of allegiance and loyalty. It may not be a matter of chance that his architectural type has been found outside Rome only in Latin colonies of the Republican period.  39},
  note = {Forum Vorbild Thus, the Roman model underpinning this theory has not, as one might expect, been found in the Forum Romanum but in the Campus Martius, where the Saepta has been identified as the direct source of inspiration for the Italian fora and their characteristic elongated shape.  40},
  note = {Saepta The Saepta is a more problematic monument than often is acknowledged. Firstly, the relationship between the Augustan and the Republican Saepta is not certain. Coarelli has shown that the Augustan Saepta maintained teh general location and orientation of teh Republican Saepta, but an expansion of the original structure, especially to the north, remains a distinct possibility.  41},
  note = {Comitium Größen Verhältnise zu Bewohnern Compared to Rome, the voting facilities would be out of proportion to the size of the population and since the scale of participation still would be an incongruous relationship between the scale of teh ''meeting space'' and the ''voting space''. The modern interpretation of colonial fora as official political spaces used for electoral and leguiislative assemblies is questioned by the lack of direct Roman models.  43},
  note = {''Gruben'' um Forum in Paestum In Cosa`s twin colony, Paestum, a large number of pits has been found bordering the forum on all the three sides that have been explored. They still await more detailed study. [...] According to Torelli, however, they represent two successive stages, the outer line having been replaced by the inner one when the forum proticus was built in Augustan times. [...] Torelli offerd no date for the first series of pits; both porticus and pits are aligned with the third-century BC tabernae that surrounded the forum.  47},
  note = {Fregellae The exploration of teh forum of Fregellae, the Latin colony famously destroyed by Opimius in 125 BC, is fairly recent, and, apart from a preliminary map of the forum area, little detailed information about the political facilites has become available yet.  51},
  note = {Gruben interpretation unterschiedlich The most striking feature of these interpretations is their ad hoc nature; no specific explanation is applicable to more than one set of pits, which is all the more surprising since they supposedly all refer back to the same urban model and draw on identical notions of political space. Given that the interpretations rely on a universalizing argument derived from Roman texts and structures, it becomes a problem that, despite superficial resemblance, the pits remain very different in size, structure and layout. If we look at the three fora that have been investigated most fully, no common pattern emerges.  54 f},
  note = {Keine ''Blaupause'' möglich In sum, no consistent pattern can be traced, either , in the structures themselves or in the modern explanations applied to them. That in itself might question the idea that the same Roman practices had provided a common blueprint. The pits appear to be locally conceived ad hoc measures, a point reinforce by the lack of chronological uniformity, which indicates that the colonists constructed these installations at very different moments of their history - and quite possibly for very diferent purposes.  57},
  note = {templum nicht durch Gruben (Pfosten) möglich Certainly, the idea that a templum could be represented by pits, in some - but not all - cases functioning as post-holes, lacks ancient authority; none of the antiquarian sources refer to ritual pits - only to enclosures.  60},
  note = {Unterschiedliche Funktionen In conclusion, the pit structures as a whole are too diverse to fit this model, which in turn raises the question as to whether any single theory will ever be able to accommodate all aspects of the material. Given their differences in size, shape and layout, they are more likely to have served a variety of different practical or ritual purposes, whose exact nature cannot be reconstructed. The structural differences seem crucial to an understanding of the material.  62},
  note = {Fazit That situation poses a problem, since the heterogeneous and unstable nature of the structures means that tehy cannot be direct copies of any Roman institution. To explain this paradox we may have to go beyond the simple model-replica perception of the relationship between foundercity and colony, and envisage more complex cultural exchanges, which may have taken place also amongst the colonies themselves. For while the inspiration for the use of pits in various civic and religious (?) contexts ultimately may have come from Rome and Latium, the new Latin communities clearly developed and modified this part of their cultural heritage independently.  64},
